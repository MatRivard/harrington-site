                    Finishing his Ph.D. in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the Technische Universiteit
                    Eindhoven in the Netherlands, Deniz decided to start his Postdoc at McGill University.
                    His research interests center around understanding the hierarchical organization of synthetic
                    and natural materials using advanced electron microscopy techniques. In his free time, he loves
                    to play chess or GTA (sometimes he plays both simultaneously) and taste beers with different
                    flavors accompanied by a delicious burger. In the future, he wishes to be able to order coffee
                    in French (well, in Québécois) at Tim Hortons.

                    Originally from Germany, Tobias joined the Harrington lab back in its days in Potsdam, where he finished his
                    Bachelor's and Master's in Biochemistry. His interest and curiosity towards nature lead him to study biological 
                    materials and their production processes with the focus on the mussel byssus. Besides research, Tobias liked to play
                    volleyball, frisbee, soccer and basically any other sport where you can enjoy a cold blonde with your team afterwards.

                    Having lived in Quebec for the better part of his life, Max graduated from McGill Chemistry
                    in 2016 to become the Harrington lab’s unofficial English-to-Joual translator. Fascination with
                    life’s complex machinery has driven his research in the fields of protein folding and self-assembly,
                    in the hopes of contributing to a new generation of bioinspired tech. Apart from reading too much sci-fi,
                    he also enjoys bouncing around Montreal’s various dancefloors and torturing dinner guests with poor
                    renditions of folk songs.

                    fortunate enough to graduate from McGill University with an honours degree in materials
                    chemistry in 2021. During his last undergraduate year, he completed his honours research
                    project in the Harrington lab because of his interest in bio-inspired materials. Obsessed
                    with nature’s exceptional material properties which surpass man-made materials, he decided to
                    accept a joint project with Dr. Blum and Dr. Harrington to engineer a new class of material that
                    integrates a non-infectious part of a virus into a polymer. Outside of school, you can catch Guido
                    playing soccer, cheering for his favorite soccer team at the top of his lungs, or simply spending
                    some time with family and friends.

                    Having been raised in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Sam received her BSc with Honours in chemistry
                    from Dalhousie University in 2021. Pursuing her interest in green chemistry, her research in
                    the Harrington group focuses on characterizing metal storage particles found in the mussel
                    byssus with the hope of using them in the creation of future bioinspired materials. Outside
                    of the lab, Sam can be found hiking, crocheting yet another sweater, or exploring Montreal's

                    Originally from Portland, Oregon, Jack is currently completing his final year of a B.Sc in chemistry at
                    McGill. Jack’s admiration for nature’s ability to solve complex problems in interesting and sustainable
                    ways lead him to the Harrington lab in the spring of 2021, where he currently works on microfluidic
                    approaches to study and replicate the self-assembly of protein-based biogenic materials. If he’s not
                    in the lab, you can most likely find Jack reading in the park, biking with friends or spending far too
                    much of his time on his skateboard.

                    Born and raised in Switzerland, Paolo is a master student in materials science and engineering from EPFL
                    (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) visiting the Harrington laboratory for his master thesis. He completed
                    a Bachelor in materials science and engineering in EPFL, during which he did an exchange at Johns Hopkins University.
                    After several projects on soft materials in Switzerland, Paolo is working on a master thesis in the Harrington
                    Laboratory on peptide functionalized microgels. Beyond science, Paolo loves to rock climb, run, and read.
